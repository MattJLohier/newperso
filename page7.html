					<h3 style="margin:0;">Background</h3>
					<p>  Cogs 187A examines the cognitive basis of successful web and multimedia design. Class topics include information architecture, navigation, usability, graphic layout, transaction design, and principles of user interaction. Above all, this course is about developing 'good taste' in web design. This means knowing what makes a site work and what weakens its usability. My final project involved redesigning First Republic Bank’s mobile experience, including usability testing, competitive analysis, wireframing, Figma prototyping, and user testing.  </p>
					<hr />
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Research and Ideation</h3>
					<p>
						First Republic is an American bank that offers personal, business, and wealth management
						financial solutions. Their customer base are primarily high net-worth individuals. They try
						to set themselves apart from other banks by creating long-lasting personal relationships with highly customized customer experiences.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose First Republic because it has a stigma as being a bank that caters to old people: after all, if the goal is to build long term relationships, a lot of the client base will be older. My idea was to see how this site could be made more usable for people from my generation, to create a concept of what the site should look like in 50 years when my generation becomes First Republic’s type of client. I’m also interested in going into the finance sector and I thought this would be a fun way of looking at UI design in that field.

					</p>
					<hr />

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Building and Testing Prototype 1</h3>
					<p>
						The first step was to build out a user testing plan and to find some users who could help me identify the weakness of First Republic’s mobile site. I prepared an interview plan with tasks, questions, and methods for observing the user. I then found four users to test with, three younger users and one above the age of fifty. The interviews lasted 30 minutes to an hour, and I recorded all of the interviews including our conversations and the participant’s screen.
					</p>

					<p>
						After the usability testing, I translated all of the results into a detailed analysis which includes the top 3 usability errors each user faced as well as any of their responses or suggestions. I evaluated the data using Nielsen’s 10 Usability heuristics to identify several categories for improvement.
					</p>

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Building and Testing Prototype 2:</h3>
					<p>
						Banking sites have to cover a very diverse range of topics that are each very deep and
						complicated using a UI that is very limited in space. They have to bridge the balance
						between commercial business with consumer’s basic needs of replacing lost credit cards
						or opening a new checking account. Banking sites require flexible UI’s, and smart decisions
						about what information to prioritize
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0;">
						For my competitive analysis, I chose to stay within the realm of banking to see the types of
						solutions other companies have for this somewhat niche problem. I also wanted to stay in
						the realm of banking sites to see the different terms, and ways each product is sold, to
						better understand each company’s priorities

					<h3 style="margin:0;">What I learned</h3>
					<p>
						I learned a lot doing this project, one of the big ones being that user testing is a lot of work
						and patience! I also used figma for the first time, which I’m happy about, because it's
						actually very easy. I learned how to manage my schedule, and how to keep my stress level
						low by working on this project a little bit everyday, instead of rushing it at the last minute.
						I'm happy with how it turned out!
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">What I would do better next time</h3>
					<p>
						I think I could generally have made better use of research and have compiled more
						statistics and information on my user test. The fact I was soloing this project made it a bit
						hard for me to find users to test with, and I was limited in the time I had with each user
						given the holidays, and the last-minuteness of my project. If I were to redo it, I would want
						to test many more users and to have a much more thorough and detailed analysis of each
						test. I could also have done a much better job of testing with people who are in the ages of
						Firstrepublic’s users and who have similar incomes. Most of my users were younger men,
						which I’m sure skewed the results of my trials in one way or another. If I was to do this
						again in a more serious setting, the age range, income, and gender mix would have to be
						taken much more seriously.
						Additionally, I could have used customer reviews more creatively in my prototypes.
						Firstrepublic tries to set itself apart with its customer centered approach. Most of the
						users didn’t really like them, and neither did I, but I think I could have done a better job at
						implementing a few in my redesigns just to keep the branding there.
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Instructor Feedback</h3>
					<p>
						<i>Great. A very thoughtful and thorough analysis, creative and inventive designs, good prototype execution, and very solid user testing. The presentation itself was fairly bland and text-heavy. Remember to think about the design and usability of your report itself! </i>
